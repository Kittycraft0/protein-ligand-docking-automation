# AutoDock Vina settings
# number of cores your computer has times 2 i think
cpu = 16
# number of precision--8 is small but fast, 16 is moderate, 32 is extreme, a study showed you get no better results really by going above 40. if the binding area is larger make sure you use a larger exhaustiveness to compensate.
exhaustiveness = 8

# Set higher for more flexible ligands
energy_range = 3

# Number of binding modes to generate
num_modes = 9
