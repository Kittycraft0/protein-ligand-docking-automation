find a tutorial that we know works already
find something that would work when published

find something I've wanted to study?


compute root mean square relative to the ABA number
aba number for that particular ligand
compared to whatever i'm docking
the ratio is used to compare ligand to protein a ligand to pritein b
can compare them directly

also compare distance to what ABA actually does
like compare how distant to the score and screen out things that stick too well

pick a system that is already been done
