hope and pray that the webpage loads

select
Rep: 3D (wait)
React: Clean

select your tranches
i did:
LogP (up to): 1, 2, 2.5, 3
Molecular Weight (up to, Daltons): 200, 250, 300, 325
so 4*4=16 tranches
got 178,955,270 Protomers. if each protomer takes 3 seconds then this would take me 17 years. i might be reading it wrong.

further filtering:

Purch: Wait OK (default)
pH: Mid
Charge: -1

top 10 molecular weights last time:
272.25 295.34 283.32 294.27 284.23 256.26 299.33 278.30 285.25 284.31
min: 256.26
max: 299.33
ok i guess the molecular weight should range from 250-325 just like it already was then idk
could technically go 200-325 cuz of how close to 250 that one is, 
or 250-300 because they're all technically still within that range

ok then:
download as:
AutoDock (*.pdbqt.gz)
Raw URLs

download to:
dock/ligands

open file (reformat because I suppose the formatting is outdated between the site and the filesystem)
ctrl+f

type in "files"
open find-and-replace and type in "files2"
click Replace all

type in "http"
open find-and-replace and type in "https"
click Replace all

save and close text editor

then either go in the files and drag and drop the zinc file onto DownloadFiles.bat or open dock/ligands in powershell and run:
./DownloadFiles.bat ZINC-downloader-3D-pdbqt.gz.uri
if the zinc file name is different then use that instead

get 7zip and
add "C:\Program Files\7-Zip" to path

e.g. look up 7zip, install the correct one for your windows, run the installer
and
windows key, type in environment variables, enter that, 
press environment variables near the bottom, pick user variables or system variables it doesn't really matter and 
then click the path under it 
then press edit in the respective part of the window

windows key
type in 7zip
click open file location
right click on the shortcut and press open file location
right click on that (i got 7zFM.exe) and click "copy as path"

go back to edit environment variable window
press new
paste in what you got earlier, i got "C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7zFM.exe" 
but remove the last part so it's just "C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7zFM.exe" so you're adding the folder instead of the file

press ok
press ok
press ok
restart terminal to update environment variables
e.g. close instances of terminal you want updated
go to dock/ligands folder
click on empty space inside the folder
click on "Open in Terminal"

run:
./UnzipFiles.bat
or just:
7z e zipped\*.gz -ounzipped\
either works if the "zipped" folder exists; you can make it yourself if you want

nevermind scratch a bunch of the above steps
run terminal
run
pip install requests
then
python .\GetLigandsForDocking.py .\ZINC-downloader-3D-pdbqt.gz.uri


nevermind forget the whole python thing entirely just do this instead:
1. download AutoDock (*.pdbqt.gz) Raw URLs
2. fix in notepad using find and replace http-->https and files-->files2
3. drag and drop fixed file onto 1DownloadFiles.bat and wait some minutes
4. double click on 2UnzipFiles.bat
5. move or copy contents of unzipped folder into dock/ligands
6. start the program -- go in the main folder and run 
python dock.py --clear-everything

if you want to stop and continue where you left off, do ctrl+c and then run
python dock.py
the program is resistant to bluescreens and other sudden stops that way through its use of a cache system

6. you can just do this right after the ligands are prepared do it when it suddenly stops:
- stop the program
- in the main folder, run 
python checkAtomTypesInCache.py dock/cache --fix
- you can run it without the "--fix" to have it just check first
- this will remove atoms such as Si from molecules and replace them with functionally similar atoms
- you can run 
restoreatomsfrombackup.py pdbqt_backups dock/cache
to restore them, probably
