took 7-20-2025 run2trial3
saw it has like 2307 ligands
found results-7-20-2025-run2trial3/results/scores/best_ligands_overall.txt

create a python file to read top 100 ligands from list and copy their associated folders into a top-100 folder, then creating images of them and putting them into the top100images folder:

open text file results-7-20-2025-run2trial3/results/scores/best_ligands_overall.txt
let top_results be a list of 100 objects:
skip lines if they start with '#', reading 100 lines after that:
	if the line says "-10.4 DDABMN.xaa_1442_model_1", then
	let score=-10.4
	let name=DDABMN.xaa_1442_model_1
	let rank=number of iterations that have gone past so far, making sure that when stringified it has 0's until its value, e.g. if rank goes up to 100 max, then the 13th rank should be stringified to 013, and the 6th rank should be stringified to 006.

for name in top_results:

	copied all molecules of form
	f"results-7-20-2025-run2trial3/results/docked_ligands/docked_{cutname}/docked_{name}_*"
	where cutname1 is DFCBMM if name=DFCBMM.xaa_01_model_1
	where cutname2 is DFCBMM_model1 if name=DFCBMM.xaa_01_model_1
	where the * picks everything available after that

	copied over to new folder named
	f"top100/{rank} {score} {name}"


create folder top100images if it does not exist

for name in top_results:
	let pdbqt_file be a file in f"top100/{score} {name}" such that its name ends with the string ".pdbqt"
	let image_name be "6 -7.3 CCEBRN0725" if name is "CCEBRN.xaa_model_0725" and score is -7.3 and rank is 6, e.g. follow that formatting
	run this command: f"obabel .\top100\{pdbqt_file} -o png -O {image_name}.png"
	(ex: obabel .\CCEBRN.xaa_model_0725.pdbqt -o png -O CCEBRN0725.png)
