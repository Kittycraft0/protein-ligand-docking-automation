first off, get the ligands into one folder, following the procedure outlines by 04 (or 03 if you've only screened once):

go into main folder, open in terminal,


run this or one of the other ones for further filtering:
python collect_hits.py dock/results/scores/scores_[your protein file name].txt dock/ligands2 --source_dir dock/results/docked_ligands --score_range [your range here, 2 numbers space separated, otherwise use full range]

ex.:
python collect_hits.py dock/results/scores/scores_PYR1_3K3K2_DOCK.txt dock/ligandsbh1 --source_dir dock/results/docked_ligands --score_range -20.0 20.0


run:
python extract_poses.py dock/ligandsbh1 dock/ligandsbh2


run:
python rename_subsequent_poses.py dock/ligandsbh2 dock/ligandsfinal


delete folders dock/ligandsbh1 and dock/ligandsbh2


make ligands pictures:
run:
python pdbqt_to_image.py dock/ligandsfinal -o dock/ligandsfinalimages


see score files in dock/results and dock/results/scores figure out what you want to look more into
find its associated image file
go to a website like scifinder-n.cas.org or similar
log in if you have to
on the right of the search bar, click Draw
draw your molecule from your image
(you can double click on the image in the image viewer on windows 11 to make the molecule image fit the window)
try to search for it

if searching doesn't work: open associated .pdbqt file in chimerax and be more specific/accurate with the protruding and recessed bonds, then try again
